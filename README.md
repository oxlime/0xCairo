## Season

Each weekend before the next F1 race we will be having our own 0xCairo races.
Friday evenings will begin with qualifier race lasting until Sundays Championship. 
On Sunday the top 20 cars will race for the championship.
The Car with the highest rating will then win the race with potential prizes.

The season will have a constructors cup Championship similiar to F1 where 
the teams (hope is to have each Starknet dapp submit a car) will earn points for each
place in the races leading up to the end of season.

Teams will need to Register for Constructor Cup Championship at the start of the Season.

## Gameplay

Friday qualifiers will have unlimited number of pit stops allowing teams to redeploy cars code.
Sunday (if u make it there) will only allow for 3 pit stops so prepare accordingly.

Submit cairo contract of your bot to the main tournament contract

Gameplay will be similiar to 0xMonaco

### Why Race

For glory, for profit, for fun

Astin Martin, Ferrari, Mercedes, etc. all sell consumer products but compete to be the fastest car at F1.
Opensea was the winners of 0xMonaco but who will be the best Cairo Engineers.
Prove onchain your team has the best and brightest engineers.
